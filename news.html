 Finnah Mariama Steven, Head of Coding at Orange Foundation, said this is the second edition of the competition. She noted that last year, Sierra Leone became the first English-speaking country to participate at the international level, winning recognition. “This year, seven schools participated,” she said, adding that all schools must first receive the Orange digital school kits to join the challenge.
