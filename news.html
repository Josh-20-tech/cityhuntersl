<!--  <p><em>The Orange Foundation Sierra Leone has awarded three winning schools E2,500 each for their outstanding performance in the Wiki Challenge for African Schools. The awards ceremony took place at the ODC Event Center, Hill Station, on 14 August 2025.
<img src="picture/WhatsApp Image 2025-08-23 at 13.43.47_f8410a92.jpg" class="pap2">The Wiki Challenge for African Schools is a multi-national writing competition that encourages students aged 8–15 to contribute articles to Vikidia, the children’s version of Wikipedia. Participating schools compete by writing articles on topics of local importance, promoting both learning and creativity.<img src="picture/WhatsApp Image 2025-08-23 at 13.43.52_09985999.jpg">
 Finnah Mariama Steven, Head of Coding at Orange Foundation, said this is the second edition of the competition. She noted that last year, Sierra Leone became the first English-speaking country to participate at the international level, winning recognition. “This year, seven schools participated,” she said, adding that all schools must first receive the Orange digital school kits to join the challenge.
<img src="picture/WhatsApp Image 2025-08-23 at 13.43.49_fa485736.jpg">Dele Preparatory School, 2024 international winner, expressed gratitude for the initiative. Philicia J. Samu said, “Winning this competition has motivated us to do more. The prize money will be used to purchase a school bus.”
Delivering the keynote address, Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Conrade Sackey, congratulated the winning schools. “Your hard work, dedication, and passion for learning have brought you here,” he said. “Each essay reflects not just individual talent but also the collective hope and potential of our future leaders. The future is bright, and it is in your hands.” He commended Orange Sierra Leone for setting a high standard in corporate citizenship.
